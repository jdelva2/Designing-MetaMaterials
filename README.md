# [Designing Meta-Materials](https://jdelva2.github.io/Designing-MetaMaterials/)

## Summary
  Meta-materials are assemblies of naturally occurring substances which exhibit unusual properties such as zero permeability and/or permittivity, or negative index of refraction. Applications include high sensitivity diagnostics, super-resolution imaging, and cloaking.

## Purpose
  Create a Python code that would serve for an open sourced Machine Learning platform TensorFlow. The Python code solves for the Reflective and Transmittance values. Using this and creating a large database of Transmittance values this would allow the Machine Learning system to optimize the best multi-layered material using the users given parameters of: number of materials, type of material, and angle/strength of wavelength projected onto the meta-surface.

## Improvements
Some improvements that can be made within this project are:
  - Implement a loop or recursive function to solve for many T-Values for the 4 Layer code at once.
  - Create a database of many combinations of Meta Materials.
  - Create a Multi-Layered code that solves for any number of Layers.

## Conclusion
  Engineers and others interested in Meta-materials may be able to use this specific 4 Layer code to create a layered structure such as the example provided (Glass/Silver) to find the best proportion of materials that will allow light to transmit through. Thus being able to produce an ENZ-like material.
